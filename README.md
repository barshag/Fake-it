I bet that the second thoughts you had is: "Naaaa, I don't capble / have the skills to accomplished something like this".
Probally it's true, but it doesn't matter cause probally Mozart didn't estanlished his poets in one shot!

In this repository we going to replicated (not duplicate!) all the major achievement that changed the world... from scratch!
All that in order to get ready, that **when we would have the groundbreaking idea, we could implement it by ourselfs!"** 

## How to contribute

You can start by forking and doing PR with the following format:
A container folder with your project name, then please add two subfolders for the reference and the replicated reference, as follows:

```javascript
--Project X
------Original_reference
------Replicated_version
```

Keep in mind that you have to implement the "Replicated_version" by yourself! No Copy-paste is allowed!
You must type it in your own way, letter by letter.
